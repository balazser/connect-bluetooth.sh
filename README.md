# Bluetooth Device Connection Script

This script uses the `bluetoothctl` to connect to a Bluetooth device using its MAC address.

## Usage

To use the script, save the script to a file, make it executable using `chmod +x <filename>`, and then run the script with the MAC address of the device you want to connect to as an argument.
